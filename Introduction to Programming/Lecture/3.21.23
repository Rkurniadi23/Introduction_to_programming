Primitive data: numbers, string, boolean
Example,
var age = 37
let age = 37
var vs let

console.log (2 + "2") = 22
but, console.log (2 - "2") = 0 
because the string is converted to number to get the result

const x = true
console.log (2 - x) = 1
because a true is 1, false is a 2

This = is equal as in x = 10
This == is equivalent
This === is the exactly equal as in the number 5 is EXACTLY equal to 5

" or ' will only read one line
` can be used to read multiple lines

modulo % is a remainder of a division operation
10 % 2 is 0
10 % 3 is 1
